# TermuxApktool
A tool for reverse engineering Android apk files (Termux)

APKTool is a tool for reverse engineering Android applications, allowing you to decode, modify, and rebuild APK files. In Termux, it enables you to work directly on your device. You can decompile an APK to view and modify its resources, then rebuild it to test changes. To use APKTool in Termux, install Java, download the APKTool jar file, and use commands like `apktool d myApp.apk` to decompile and `apktool b myApp` to rebuild. This integration offers a powerful and efficient way to customize Android apps.
